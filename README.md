## End to end thyroid detection


The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in front of the neck. It produces hormones that play a key role in regulating blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, metabolism, and the reaction of the body to other hormones. Thyroid disorders can affect heart rate, mood, energy level, metabolism, bone health, pregnancy, and many other functions. When your thyroid gland does not work properly, it can impact your entire body. If your body has too much or too little thyroid hormone then there are chances to have Thyroid disorder which is serious and needs to be treated by your healthcare provider. In this study, we have developed a model using different machine learning algorithms that can predict “whether the person has Thyroid disease or not”? So that healthcare providers can give clear and confident results to patients
